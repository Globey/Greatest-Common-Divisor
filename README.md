Greatest-Common-Divisor
=======================

gcd(int1,int2) is a function that implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.

gcd(int1,int2) takes two integers as parameters and returns their greatest common divisor (also an integer).

Example #1:

In this example we are going to find the greatest common divisor of 330 and 90 and print a little message.
(We're going to assume that python 2.7 is being used)

INPUT: <br \>
x = gcd(330,90)<br \>
print "The greatest common divisor of 330 and 90 is " + str(x) + "." <br \>

OUTPUT: <br \>
The greatest common divisor of 330 and 90 is 30.

Example #2

In this example we're going to find the greatest common divisor of 23001 and 3145 and print a little message.

INPUT: <br \>
greatest_common_divisor = gcd(23001,3145) <br \>
print "The greatest common divisor of 23001 and 3145 is " + str(greatest_common_divisor)  + "!" <br \>

OUTPUT: <br \>
The greatest common divisor of 23001 and 3145 is 17!
